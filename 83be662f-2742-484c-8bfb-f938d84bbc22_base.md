# Additional Constraints

1\. The course taken in the Ethics List can also be used towards the CSE or the PD requirements.

2\. For the Natural Science requirement, if a 0.25-laboratory course accompanies a lecture course, the laboratory course must also be taken and the
pair together count as one course towards the two-course requirement (e.g., BIOL130 with BIOL130L).

3\. At least one TE, to a maximum of two, must be from another engineering (other than Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering) plan; such
courses must have sufficiently advanced engineering science or engineering design content to be allowed, and must be approved by the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Undergraduate Office.

4\. Exceptions to the requirements and electives listed above require prior approval of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Chair,
Undergraduate Studies.


# Specializations

Students may choose to focus their elective choices by completing one (or more) of two available specializations.

The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and
Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles
on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning,
teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the Office of Indigenous Relations <https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous>.
